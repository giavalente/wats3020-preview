## Preview of Final Project
For this assignment use the repository you already created for your project.  
For this phase of the Final Project, you must provide us with glimpse into your progress.

## Base Requirements
* In-progress build of your project available at a URL
* Summary of where you are in the build-out of your project
You should have the basic page layout and core styles set at this point, and you should have your basic JavaScript features put in place. You will spend the week following this polishing your project for final delivery.

## Deliverables
* URL of the location where you've deployed your project for viewing
* URL of the repository for your fork of the assignment repository
* Note about how the project went for you. In your note, you may want to discuss:
* Were there any particularly difficult/easy elements?
* What part did you enjoy the most/least?
* If you had time to do it over again, what would you be sure to do differently?
